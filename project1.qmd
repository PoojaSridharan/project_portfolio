### Project Brief

**SQL Project: Economic and Social Analysis of Countries**\
This SQL-based project provides an in-depth analysis of the economic and social well-being of countries across multiple indicators, including GDP, corruption, cost of living, tourism, and unemployment rates. By exploring the relationships between these factors, the analysis reveals key insights into how wealth, corruption, and tourism influence a countryâ€™s economic health. Objectives include examining how corruption correlates with GDP, how cost of living impacts tourism and unemployment, and ranking countries by overall economic health using a composite index. The project also clusters countries into performance groups, offering a clear comparison framework for economic stability and policy insights.
